# PM Brain Evaluation Report

## Objective

The goal of this evaluation was **not** to evaluate PM Brain as an end user over weeks or months.

Instead, the objective was to evaluate the **architecture** by answering questions like:

* Does the brain retrieve stored knowledge correctly?
* Does it remember information across new sessions?
* Does it resist hallucinating missing information?
* Can it ingest new information and propagate it across the knowledge base?
* Can it reason across multiple documents instead of simply retrieving text?

| ------- | --------------------------------- | -------- |
| Phase 1 | Verify knowledge retrieval        | ✅ Passed |
| Phase 2 | Verify ingestion & memory updates | ✅ Passed |
| Phase 3 | Verify cross-document reasoning   | ✅ Passed |

# Phase 1 — Brain Verification

## Test 1 — Strategic Priorities

### Prompt

```text
What are our top priorities?
```

### What this tested

* Retrieval from stored strategy
* Accuracy of stored information
* Context-aware responses
* No hallucinations

### Success Criteria

* Retrieves all strategic priorities
* Includes goals and metrics
* Explains business context
* Does not invent additional priorities

### Result

✅ Passed

The brain correctly retrieved all strategic priorities, preserved the associated metrics, and explained the strategic trade-offs without inventing new information.

---

## Test 2 — Stakeholder Retrieval

### Prompt

```text
Who is David Kim?
```

### What this tested

* Stakeholder memory
* Relationship retrieval
* Stakeholder reasoning
* New-session persistence

### Success Criteria

* Correct role
* Correct responsibilities
* Correct concerns
* Correct meeting cadence
* Retrieves from stored knowledge

### Result

✅ Passed

The brain accurately retrieved David Kim's profile, including his responsibilities, concerns, communication context, and recurring meetings.

---

## Test 3 — Strategic Reasoning

### Prompt

```text
Why are we investing in AI Incident Copilot?
```

### What this tested

* Cross-document reasoning
* Strategy understanding
* Feature understanding
* Decision reasoning

### Success Criteria

* Explains why Copilot exists
* Connects product strategy
* Connects current roadmap
* Connects existing evidence
* Identifies missing knowledge where appropriate

### Result

✅ Passed

The brain synthesized information across strategy, active initiatives, and recently shipped features. It also identified missing hypothesis documentation instead of pretending it existed.

---

## Test 4 — Hallucination Resistance

### Prompt

```text
Who is our CFO?
```

### What this tested

* Unknown knowledge handling
* Hallucination resistance
* Boundary awareness

### Success Criteria

* Says it does not know
* Does not invent a CFO
* Clearly identifies missing information

### Result

✅ Passed

The brain explicitly stated that no CFO existed in the knowledge base and avoided fabricating an answer.

---

# Phase 2 — Ingestion & Memory

## Test Scenario

A fictional **AI Copilot Steering Committee** meeting was ingested.

The meeting included:

* Product decision
* Engineering feedback
* Customer Success feedback
* Feature scope changes
* Action items
* New hypotheses

The artifact was ingested using:

```text
/ingest
```

---

## What this tested

* Artifact classification
* Knowledge routing
* Decision extraction
* Stakeholder updates
* Feature updates
* Hypothesis creation
* Knowledge propagation

---

## Expected Behavior

The brain should:

* Store the original meeting
* Create a structured ingestion
* Create a decision
* Update feature scope
* Update stakeholders
* Create hypotheses
* Update indexes

---

## Actual Result

The brain updated:

* `source/`
* `ingestion/`
* `decisions/`
* `knowledge/`
* `hypotheses/`
* `stakeholders/`
* `INDEX` files

It also detected:

* unresolved assumptions
* contradictory evidence
* missing information
* follow-up questions

### Result

✅ Passed

The brain successfully propagated the meeting across multiple knowledge areas rather than storing it as a simple note.

---

# Phase 3 — Memory Verification

## Test 1

### Prompt

```text
What changed after today's AI Copilot steering meeting?
```

### What this tested

* Memory persistence
* Decision recall
* Knowledge updates
* New-session retrieval

### Success Criteria

The response should mention:

* Updated feature scope
* Decision
* New hypotheses
* Stakeholder updates
* Remaining uncertainties

### Result

✅ Passed

The brain correctly summarized the changes introduced by the meeting and identified outstanding assumptions.

---

## Test 2

### Prompt

```text
What does David Kim currently think?
```

### What this tested

* Stakeholder evolution
* Memory updates
* Historical context

### Success Criteria

* Reflects latest meeting
* Preserves previous stakeholder context
* Explains current position

### Result

✅ Passed

The brain combined David Kim's historical profile with the latest meeting updates to produce an up-to-date stakeholder view.

---

# Phase 4 — Cross-Document Reasoning (Stress Test)

## Prompt

```text
We're considering delaying AI Incident Copilot by one sprint.

Analyze this decision using everything in the brain.

Specifically:
- Which strategic priorities are affected?
- Which stakeholders are likely to support or oppose it, and why?
- Which active initiatives become riskier?
- What previous decisions or evidence are relevant?
- Which hypotheses become more or less likely?
- What information is still missing before making this decision?

Don't just summarize existing files—synthesize them into a recommendation.
```

---

## What this tested

* Cross-document reasoning
* Decision analysis
* Stakeholder reasoning
* Strategic reasoning
* Hypothesis reasoning
* Recommendation quality

---

## Success Criteria

The response should:

* Connect multiple knowledge files
* Explain trade-offs
* Use previous decisions
* Use stakeholder context
* Use hypotheses
* Identify missing information
* Produce a recommendation

### Result

✅ Passed

The brain synthesized information from strategy, stakeholders, decisions, hypotheses, and feature knowledge into a coherent recommendation instead of simply summarizing existing documents.
